I will provide you with a source entity and 10 target entities. Your task is to select the target entity that most closely matches the source entity.
Each entity has three types of information: 
1. Name information
2. Attribute triples
3. Relationship triples

Follow this selection process:
1. Prioritize Name information as the primary criterion.
2. If Name information is ambiguous, use Attribute triples as a secondary criterion.
3. Finally, use Relationship triples as the tertiary criterion.

Once you are confident, return only the ID of the target entity you believe is the best match. Do not include any explanations, names, or other content in your responseâ€”ONLY the ID.
